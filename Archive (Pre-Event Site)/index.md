### Innovation Challenge

The Innovation Challenge is your chance to show your creativity and skills. You'll be tasked with creating an idea that will solve a global issue, build a basic prototype and then pitch it. It may sound daunting but no need to worry you will be guided through the process by accomplished mentors who have done it before. Additionally, the workshops happening throughout the week will help you pick up the technical skills needed and an exclusive pitching workshop just for competitors will give you the perfect pitch to win.

You can watch the debate at the innovation suite on Friday the 14th of February.

### I Love Free Software Day

Free Software drives a huge number of devices in our everyday lives. It ensures our freedom, our security, civil rights, and privacy. It enables everyone to participate in a fair society. I Love Free Software Day, organized by Free Software Foundation Europe, spreads awareness and appreciation for Free Software. It is the perfect day to say **thank you** to the contributors of the various Free Software we love: developers, translators, designers, testers, or documentation writers, of huge software or smaller projects. All of them work to keep the Free Software ecosystem which we enjoy every day healthy, vibrant, and growing.

So join us on the 14 of February and the final day of Innovation Week as we celebrate in collaboration with Free Software Foundation Europe all the free software in our world. Throughout the week we will also discussing the importance of Free Software and you can [learn more here](https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/index.en.html).
