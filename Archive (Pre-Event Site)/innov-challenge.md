The Innovation Challenge is your chance to show your creativity and skills. You'll be tasked with creating an idea that will solve a global issue, build a basic prototype and then pitch it. It may sound daunting but no need to worry you will be guided through the process by accomplished mentors who have done it before. Additionally, the workshops happening throughout the week will help you pick up the technical skills needed and an exclusive pitching workshop just for competitors will give you the perfect pitch to win.

TLDR; Participants should create an idea that can solve a Global Goal listed below. They should then create a prototype that represents the solution (eg. Mobile App Mockup or 3D Render of Product). They should then create a quick write up involving a summary of the project and how it solves the Global Issue. Based on this, they will present their work at a fair. The winner will be selected based on their pitch as well as the quality of their prototype.

Above are the key four stages of the competition.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge.

1. Join the WhatsApp group we shared with you!

2. Attend the Introduction Meeting at the Innovation Suite on Friday the 7th of Feb.

3. Choose a Global Issue from the [List Below](Global-Issues) or an issue in your local community.

4. Brainstorm ideas for a product that could help solve this issue.A good resource to help with brainstorming is [Ideo's guide](https://www.ideou.com/pages/brainstorming).

5. Now select one idea from your brainstorm. To select your final idea we recommend you use a Pugh chart like [this one for Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12jvLjEAkh1baQ4FG6hwC-ztA4dXR-L9lTM_v6XlwUbc/edit?usp=sharing).

6. Build a prototype of your product idea. If there's anything you need to borrow or you need help let us know on the Gitter channel. You can also visit us at the support sessions happening every lunch time and after school at the Innovation Suite from Monday to Thursday.

7. Write a 250 word summary. You summary should include what your idea is (this is the main part), how you made your prototype and how you would make the real thing. You should also explain it's impact and show us the legitimacy of your claim that it will solve the issue so use stats and other research.

9. Design a logo that is 500px x 500px for your project. Save it as a .png.

10. You now need to submit your project. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/gemssingaporestudentcouncil/innovationweek2020/blob/master/resources/how-to-submit.md). If you need further help contact us on Gitter or visit any support session happening every lunch time and after school at the Innovation Suite from Monday to Thursday. 

11. To prepare for the showcase meet up with your team and create a pitch that will tell the judge: what your idea is, show them your prototype and the impact of your idea. It should have similar content to your two pieces of writing. 

12. Prepare materials to display at the showcase. You must display your prototype and choose anything else to bring such as brochures. If there's anything you need to borrow let us know on the Gitter channel. We will printing what you submit in the written section in a nice looking banner, so don't worry. You will have a table to place your items.

13. On the Friday the 14th Feb, we will start preparing at 1:00pm for the presentation. You will need to be there by 1:45pm. We will give a final briefing and help you set up. PLEASE BE PREPARED! Also, let us know if you need help or have a problem ASAP.
